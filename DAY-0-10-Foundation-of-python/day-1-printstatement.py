I am singing up for Replit's 100 days of Python
challenge!
I will make sure to spend some time every day coding 
along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day.
I'll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE so I can do
this from my phone wherever I happen to be. No excuses 
for not coding from the middle of a field!
I am feeling ðŸ¥³
